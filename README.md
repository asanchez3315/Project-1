# Socimood

## Description
Socimood is a quick way to search movie plots and analyze them for the tone and mood. You'll receive results of a searched movie for positivity, negativity, and other criteria to see if the film is suitable for the audience you have in mind.

Socimood is useful for parents or teachers who wish to get a quick look at whether the movie is suitable for children or other special audiences.

See the deployed application at [socimood.me](http://socimood.me).
